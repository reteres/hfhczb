　　流淌着的情感河流有时在诗文中涌动，从遥远的地方而来，一直到今天，还会到永远。“锄禾日当午，汗滴禾下土。谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦。”这是对劳动人民的怜悯之情；“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐。”这是忧国忧民的大情总结；“春眠不觉晓，处处闻啼鸟。夜来风雨声，花落知多少。”这是对大自然的感知和热爱之情；朱自清的《背影》，让我们品味到深深的父爱和浓浓的父子情；鲁迅的《药》，充盈着关注社会和底层的朴素情感。其实不止以上所举，应该说，所有用心而就的感人诗文，其实都是用情所至，是感情的流露，真情的再现。
戚戚沥沥的秋雨，一场接着一场的下，以致秋天提早光临到了广柔的西蜀地面上。往日的天高气爽，蓝天乌云，遽然变得时隐时现，和人们着起了迷藏。罕见，真是罕见啊!在国产爱人节的功夫，少见的烈日果然展示了，烈日染在秋风之中，还带上了丝丝暖意。

Neighbor is like photography, often to travel, like to take a digital camera, don't take the handsome yourself, don't clap a beautiful young girlfriend, specially take the flowers those trees, lotus pond blooming, pat through childhood memories of lentils flower...
In his blog, he writes, see the people in the city, their long gun of the bombing of so many people go to the park a few lotus, there are two different feeling in my heart.
What's the two kind of feeling?
He said, it is happy for yourself, live in the countryside, and close to nature, surrounded by so many to take flowers.
2 it is to feel lonely again: the size of a lotus pond edge, hundreds of lotus has open, different time a dozen times to shoot, never met a person in the lotus pond, even if it is only the viewer.
I think, however, may be in such a quiet place, the small town of lotus to increasingly shows her willing to lonely, more bloom out of her unique fragrance, shows the noble and pure, this is the very good lotus!
Life is short and only once, don't care about other people light together, only I step a trail and strengthened.
